# OS & SP Assignment 2
This is the code for a C assignment for the OS & Systems Programming module during my second year at the University of Birmingham. It involves implementing a concurrent version of a reversed binary search tree (BST) in C. I received 14/15 for it. The one mark that was lost was due to line 12 in ```serve_client.c``` which instead of

```c
for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) { 
```

should have been

```c
for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) { 
```
